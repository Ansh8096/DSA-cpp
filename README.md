# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C++ 🚀

Welcome to **DSA-cpp** 👋  
This repository contains my hands-on practice and implementations of **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**.

📌 **Important Note:**  
✅ Only the topics that are present as folders in this repository are currently covered.  
❌ Other DSA topics are not implemented yet.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is built for:

- ✅ Learning DSA step-by-step in C++
- 🎯 Interview preparation
- 🧠 Improving problem-solving skills
- 📚 Quick revision using folder-wise topics

Each folder represents a DSA topic and contains programs/problems related to that topic.

## 📂 Topics Covered (As Per Repository Folders)

📌 The topics covered are exactly the folder names present inside this repo.

Example structure:

```
DSA-cpp/
│── src/
│   ├── <Topic-1>/
│   ├── <Topic-2>/
│   ├── <Topic-3>/

## 🚀 How to Use / Run

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ansh8096/DSA-cpp.git
```

### 2️⃣ Navigate to the Project Folder
```bash
cd DSA-cpp
```

### 3️⃣ Compile & Run a C++ Program
